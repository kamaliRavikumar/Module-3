### AIM  
To Write a python program to find the smallest among three Integer  Numbers
---

### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.
2. Input three integer numbers: a, b, and c.
3. Use the built-in min() function to find the smallest among the three numbers.
4. Store the result in a variable smallest.
5. Display the smallest number with the original inputs.
6. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
smallest = min(a,b,c)
print(f"The Smallest  of the three a= {a} b= {b} c= {c} is {smallest}")
```
